\chapter{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Ground view images of Mars are comparatively commonplace in the modern
day, thanks to the ongoing work of the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, the
imagery currently is only able to capture a miniscule slice of mars as a whole.
Due to the limited mobility and time of the Mars rovers, only very small and
particularly interesting areas of Mars have been seen thus far.

There exists, however, a large quantity of high-resolution satellite imagery of
the martian surface, along with accompanying digital elevation models (DEMs).
From this data, we believe a large quantity of data about the martian surface
can be inferred from contextual information, allowing the problem to be viewed
as a kind of upscaling problem. To this end, generative machine learning is
well-suited, as it has been applied with success at finding and enhancing latent
detail with applications focusing on upscaling images [SOURCE].
